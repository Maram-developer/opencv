✨Object Detection using OpenCV (Inference)

Description:
A real-time object detection system using OpenCV and a pre-trained SSD MobileNet v3 model. The system detects multiple objects from a webcam feed and draws bounding boxes with class labels.

Key Concepts:
Object Detection, DNN, Real-time Video Processing, Computer Vision

✨Hand Tracking Mini Game (Catch the Enemy)

Description:
An interactive computer vision mini-game where the player uses their index finger to catch a moving target on the screen. Each successful hit increases the score.

Key Concepts:
Game Logic, Hand Tracking, Real-time Interaction, AI + OpenCV

✨Line Detection using Computer Vision

Description:
A line detection system that uses color segmentation, edge detection, and the Hough Transform to detect yellow lane-like lines in real time.

Key Concepts:
Edge Detection, Hough Transform, Image Processing

✨Finger Counting using Hand Tracking

Description:
A real-time hand tracking application that detects hand landmarks and counts the number of raised fingers using MediaPipe Hands.

Key Concepts:
Hand Landmark Detection, Gesture Recognition, Human–Computer Interaction

✨Color Detection using OpenCV

Description:
Real-time color detection using OpenCV and HSV color space. The system identifies the color of the center pixel from a live webcam feed and displays the detected color dynamically.

Key Concepts:
Computer Vision, HSV Color Space, Real-time Video Processing

✨Face Detection using MediaPipe

Description:
A real-time face detection system using MediaPipe. It detects multiple faces from a webcam feed, draws bounding boxes, and displays the total number of detected faces.

Key Concepts:
MediaPipe, Face Detection, Real-time AI Applications

✨Eye Movement Detection using OpenCV

Description:
A video-based eye movement detection system that localizes eye regions using contour detection to analyze eye motion.

Key Concepts:
Contour Detection, Video Processing, Classical Computer Vision
